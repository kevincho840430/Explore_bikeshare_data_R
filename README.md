### Project Title
udacity_project:Explore_bikeshare_data_r


### Description
In this project, I'll make use of R to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I'll write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations!.

Bike Share Data Details: Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
Thanks
